# gitlab-free-local-server-using-docker-compose
This repo contains a docker compose script to set up a local instance of GitLab server. Itâ€™s an alternative to GitHub able to run locally for free and is very easy to set up. The script was tested on Linux and Windows but should work on any platform able to run Docker.
